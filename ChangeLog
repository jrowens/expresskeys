_Version 0.2.2 5 May 2005_

* Included an example of how to use an external program through
the simple "system" command (see exec_shell.c). The sample
"xsetwacom" utilization (pen pressure sensitivity) is not particularly
exciting as a new feature, but nevertheless an opening for future
implementations.

It's hard to imagine someone wasting three full expresskeys to get
a comfortable workflow, but here you are:

Keycode field value (regular button only, not touch strips or Plus)
1001 <-- Pen sensitivity gets lower with each press, until roll over.
1002 <-- Pen sensitivity is set to wacom default, a middle curve.
1003 <-- Pen sensitivity gets higher with each press, until roll over.

A pen name must be specified on the command line, of course.

Since both the 1001 and 1003 flip over in a carousel fashion at the
top and bottom values, you could manage the operation with only one
button. But if you go too far, there are 6 presses to be made until
next rendezvous in the 7 state circle. Not good.

The curve values are picked from how the "wacomcpl" program sets them
(the tcl utility) in Feel -> Sensitivity [1 to 7].

I've refrained from documenting the 1001 - 1003 in the USAGE file, and
a new configuration file won't have them listed in the header. The real
world usability is too limited, I feel. Better things will hopefully
come in the future.

The old pen mode toggle code could be rewritten so it was handled by
this external xsetwacom functionality, in good *nix tradition of reuse.
But what if the user environment doesn't have the xsetwacom program
installed? Better leave the code as is, I think.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Speaking of the future, this 0.2.2 version will be the last one (from me
at least) for quite some time. When I began the project, more than 1 1/2
months ago, it was out of pure necessity. I had a brand new (expensive)
Wacom tablet with semi functional hardware. Extensive web searches didn't
reveal any program to unlock the enticing ExpressKeys and Touch Strips,
so I reluctantly opened a C language book and set to work.

I never planned to enter the "programmer" domain in earnest. Neither
did I anticipate a perpetual development. When the job was done, it
would be done...

And now it's done, from my point of view. Core functions are rather
complete, and the program runs without hiccups. Ideas have dried up
and I am frankly getting bored with code hacking. Now I want to USE
the tablet, finally.

The code is free as in beer and freedom. If anyone feels like expanding
or even forking it, just do so (according to the GPL). There's the whole
bag of internationalization, installation and graphical configuration
left to a fresh mind. I'm too tired right now.

Though, I'll dive in again if a pressing issue turns up ;-)

Bye for now,
Mats

_Version 0.2.1 2 May 2005_

* Added support for faking mouse button events. Denis DerSarkisian
sent a function called "fake_event" (top of event_loop.c) which
in essence acts like a traffic cop, steering true keycodes to
XTestFakeKeyEvent and a set of false ones to XTestFakeButtonEvent.
The fake codes can be entered as 991 to 997 in the configuration
file, simulating mouse buttons 1 to 7.

Only existing mouse buttons, defined through the driver of the
active core pointer, can be simulated. I added discovery code to
prevent a crash if someone tries to use a nonexistent mouse button
in the range 1 to 7.

The code author wanted his touch strips to act like a mouse's scroll
wheel through the use of mouse buttons 4 - 5 (Up/Down) and 6 - 7
(Left/Right). I only have a three button mouse, the Wacom puck is
not a core pointer, but can make good use of the new functionality
in eg the web browser Opera:

[...]
20 Right Pad - Button 14:	993		# Button 14
21 Right Pad - Button 14 Plus:	991		# Extra key
[...]
24 Right Pad - Button 16:	991		# Button 16
25 Right Pad - Button 16 Plus:	993		# Extra key
[...]

With those definitions I step backwards (14) and forwards (16) in
the visited page history. Opera's "forward" can also take me to
the "Next" linked page, so it's very convenient when having a long
reading session.

* Expanded the "-v" (verbose mode) printing to cover more execution
points and be a lot more detailed.

* Racked my brain and added some more knowledge to the BUGS file.


_Version 0.2.0 29 April 2005_

(NOTE: A version of this archive was pulled from the website after a
few hours of exposure on April 28, based on the suspicion that it
contained a corrupt file due to some file system issues on my machine.
Both fears were unfounded. I've spent this interim on further
restructuring of the text files outside of the code directories)

* New configuration file format. Incompatible with the old one, hence
the version bump from 0.1 to 0.2

Move/rename the old file and run the program to get a new. Then edit...

The old format was basically just a transcript of how a C structure
is initialized. It had nothing in common with how a configuration
file in *nix should be construed.

Rules for the new configuration file is: Blank lines and everything
after a "#" is discarded. Full program records begin and end with
a double percentage sign "%%". A program field begins after a colon ":".
The program names must be within two double quotes "". Like so:

"A ProgramName" <-- OK
" A ProgramName" or "A ProgramName " <-- NOT-OK

This is in accordance with the old rule about how to deal with spaces
in that field.

I can only vouch for parsing sanity if each line in the file is kept
below 160 bytes in length (see the BUGS file). That's the equiv of
two old style terminal lines. If you want more, change the MAXBUFFER
value in globals.h

* Another command line option: "-v". Will turn on the be_verbose flag
which prints info to the screen from plenty of program execution points.
An aid for debugging, or just checking out the runtime state.

* Got rid of the ugly switch routines in event_loop.c and config_read.c.
I've done extensive benchmarking and see no difference in code speed.
Advantage, apart from code simplicity, is that the compiled program
size was reduced by ca 4000 bytes - before the 0.2.0 additions.


_Version 0.1.4 24 April 2005_

* Memory bugfix. Running the program under Valgrind to catch memory
leaks and other errors I finally saw the reason for me needing
heap_protect kludges. Doing XFreeDeviceList on a structure and then
reading data from the freed memory only works through luck...

* Took the opportunity to free lingering memory allocations at program
exit. It's not strictly necessary since the OS should reclaim it all,
but looks nice in the Valgrind summary. There's still one left that
I can't find the souce of. It belongs to XextCreateExtension apparently.

* Bugfix: Had forgotten to close the error.log after writing to it in
the exit_on_error function. Also, that function shouldn't do a final
exit(EXIT_KO) but instead jump to clean_up_exit(SIGTERM). However,
doing that it won't return the EXIT_KO to any parent. I'd have to
change the signal handling to achieve this.

* Bugfix: The config file version tag was meant to look like:

Version: 1

and nothing else, for now... The confusion and uncertainty stems from
doing this before a final format has been chosen. There are many factors
to consider, so bear with me.

* Reverted to the "expresskeys" base name on compile output and shell
files. When writing code it's more convenient with a short name, but
any final product should have a consistent naming.


_Version 0.1.3 21 April 2005_

* Just internal code cleanup/restructuring after having begun reading
"The Art of Unix Programming" by Eric Steven Raymond:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/

* Now tags a new configuration file with a version number according to
his advice: "Always, _always_ either include a version number, or ...".
Expect more internal changes when I'm done reading. In an already
existing configuration file you'll have to add it manually. Put a:

Config File Version 1:

on a line by itself at the very top.


_Version 0.1.2 20 April 2005_

* Signal handling in place. Not much in itself, but:

* Re-reads the configuration file upon receipt of the signal SIGUSR1.
Do a "kill -USR1 <pid-of-ekeys>" after a config file edit. That's USR
and the digit 1. I've also modified USR2 to do the same thing, for
now at least.

Included is a shell script called ekeys-reread.sh which does it for you
if ekeys is running in daemon mode. Also included is ekeys-terminate.sh
which replaces the former ekeys-kill.sh (a bit smarter).

* The program will now refuse to start if it detects another instance
running. Only works if there is a pid-file to examine of course.
A pid-file left by a crash (will never happen...) and not connected
with any process by that number is ignored, and the program continues.

* A properly terminated program deletes the pid-file upon exit. Proper
means a normal "kill <pid>", "killall ekeys", "kill -TERM <pid>" etc.
Doing a brutal "kill -9 <pid>" or if the program crashes (cough, cough)
will leave the pid-file undeleted.

* Any error, encountered by the code, which terminates the program is
written to the file "error.log" as well as to the screen. A restart
truncates the file (it becomes size 0). This means that there always
will be an error.log present, but empty in normal cases.


_Version 0.1.1 17 April 2005_

* Now reads an external configuration file at program launch. It
searches in the user home directory under the hidden "/.expresskeys"
directory. File is called "expresskeys.conf". If none is found, or
the directory doesn't exist yet, it makes the dir, then creates and
populates a minimal file from an internal list. The original "default",
"Gimp", "Blender" and "XTerm" entries. It then goes on and reads in
that file immediately. A limit of 64 different program definitions
has been set (easily altered in the code). It's way more than most
would need, since the "default" is fine for a huge group of programs.

Rules for the configuration file is: Don't use { or } in comments,
and preferably keep comments outside of program definitions. The
comma (,) inside a definition is still used to separate all the
fields. Program names don't need the embracing quotes "" but I
kept the default list using them. Since spaces are accepted as part
of a class name, make sure there are no space _before or after_ the
name, prior to the terminating field comma:

{"A ProgramName", or {A ProgramName,    <-- OK
{"A ProgramName" , or { A ProgramName,  <-- NOT-OK

The extra space/s would become part of the class name. Not what you want.
If you absolutely must put some space before the comma, use TAB instead.
Those are discarded while parsing the string.

* Pen handling is now specified on the command line, eg:

ekeys pad stylus

The value for pen mode switch in the configuration file is still 999.

Yes, "ekeys" :-) I changed the compile output to that name. The code
tarball will still be named expresskeys though. Doing a web search
revealed it to be rather unique to the Intuos3, while ekeys turned
up music hardware and relatives. But, naturally, feel free to name it
badzilla or VincentVanGogh instead. Program behaviour is not dependent
on the file name.

* Another command line change, to make it run in the background:

ekeys pad stylus -d

It then runs in "daemon" mode. The difference between pushing it
with a terminating & or letting internal code "fork" it is beyond
most peoples interest. I can already hear the snores building up...
But in terms of how I've coded stuff it still matters.

If the program is launched into daemon mode, it writes out another
file in the configuration directory: "expresskeys.pid". A
process identification (PID) is a unique number, separating the
program from all the other stuff you have running. The number can
be used, for example, to do an easy kill.

I've included a simple shell script (called ekeys-kill.sh) which reads the
expresskeys.pid and tries to kill whatever process that has the pid,
so do a "ps aux | grep ekeys" beforehand to be sure it's running
(and don't confuse your "grep ekeys" with an actual "ekeys" instance).
Add a line to start ekeys directly after a kill and you have an easy
path when doing config file changes. The pid file is not automatically
deleted by internal code on exit (yet).

* For any programmer out there, or curious user, I've now filled the
code with comments. It had to be done at some point...


_Version 0.1.0 5 April 2005_

Just internal changes. A massive rewrite to get rid of cruft, and
put my own stink on the whole code structure. Ah yes, I then GPL-d
the result...
