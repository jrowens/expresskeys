_Wish-list_

+ Graphical client for editing the configuration file, signalling
the server to re-read it when done. Should optimally fill in the
keycodes when user pushes a key (maybe just show the key) and fill
in the class name as well when user clicks on a window.

+ Replace ASCII with something more international, like UTF-8.

+ Make the code 64-bit clean.
