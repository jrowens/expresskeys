This program gives linux support for the ExpressKeys and Touch Strips
of a Wacom Intuos3 tablet or a Cintiq 21UX Interactive Pen Display.

It can also provide an automatic change of stylus pressure sensitivity
- aka PressCurve - going from one program window to the next, by way
of "xsetwacom" from the driver package at linuxwacom.sourceforge.net
This feature is totally independent of the connected Wacom tablet model.

Latest version can be found through the project page at:

The USAGE file lists all the important and current key points for
program configuration and execution.

NEWS gives a quick view of changes. Expanded in ChangeLog.

The INSTALL file keeps compilation information.

BUGS lists the known cases.

TODO is a wish-list, not a promise.

latter also gives explicit permission for the code and program usage.

Reading the ChangeLog files from bottom and up can kill some time and
provide historic insight. They constitute a very outdated user
documentation.
