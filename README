The USAGE file lists all the important and current key points for
program configuration and execution.

NEWS gives a quick view of changes. Expanded in ChangeLog.

The INSTALL file keeps compilation information.

BUGS lists the known cases.

TODO is a wish-list, not a promise.

AUTHORS and Copyright speak of who it was that wrote the code. The
latter also gives explicit permission for the code and program usage.

LICENSE is a copy of the GNU General Public License Version 2.

Reading the ChangeLog files from bottom and up can kill some time and
provide historic insight. They constitute a very outdated user
documentation.
