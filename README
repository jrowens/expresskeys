This program gives linux support for the ExpressKeys and Touch Strips of Wacom
Intuos3 tablets, Cintiq 21UX Interactive Pen Displays and the Scroll Wheel and
two ExpressKeys of the Graphire4 / Graphire4 BlueTooth.

It can also provide an automatic change of stylus pressure sensitivity - aka
PressCurve - going from one program window to the next, by way of "xsetwacom"
from the driver package at linuxwacom.sourceforge.net This feature is
independent of the connected tablet model.

A maximum of fifteen tablets (three of each model) can be handled concurrently.
'Models': nopad, Graphire4 BlueTooth, Graphire4, Intuos3 small, Intuos3/Cintiq
