_Known bugs marked with FIXME in the code_

! Parsing of the configuration file still leaves some corner cases
to chance. The behaviour when reading in the next line/part, after
having cut a line longer than MAXBUFFER, is totally unpredictable.

! The exit_on_error function drops the EXIT_KO when callig
clean_up_exit. It becomes a normal EXIT_OK signal for any controlling
parent.

_Possible bugs, unmarked_

! I've tried to break the parsing of the configuration file with
different scenarios, but am limited by my imagination of how
broken a file can be...

_Known bugs, unmarked_

! Should ignore a pen mode 999 definition in the "Plus" button fields.
