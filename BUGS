_Known bugs marked with FIXME in the code_

! Parsing of the configuration file still leaves some corner cases
to chance. The behaviour when reading in the next line/part, after
having cut a line longer than MAXBUFFER, is totally unpredictable.

Also doesn't handle situations where multiple fields are specified
on the same line, or if the program record begin/end "%%" sign is
written in a field line. Possibly other cases.

! The exit_on_error function drops the EXIT_KO when callig
clean_up_exit. It becomes a normal EXIT_OK signal for any controlling
parent.

! Should check that only valid keycodes (and our fake ones) are used
in a program definition. It is only partially fixed by filtering out
anything below the keycode 9 [Esc]. Should ignore erroneous spaces in
the class name field.

_Possible bugs, unmarked_

! In eg Gimp, if expresskeys is started with the option to handle a pen,
my core pointer (an USB mouse) and the Wacom puck do not draw through
button 1 or react to mouse button 2 and 3 presses until the Wacom stylus
has come into proximity for the first time. After the first proximity,
the mouse and puck react normally. Strange...

! If the expresskeys program is started before any usage of the
X program "xmodmap" in eg .xinitrc, it can crash with the message:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  15 (X_QueryTree)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x1
  Serial number of failed request:  20
  Current serial number in output stream:  20

Reason, totally unknown...

_Known bugs, unmarked_

! Pressing a pad button with one program window in focus, moving the
focus to another program window and then releasing the button, leaves
the first program in a confused mind regarding the keyboard state.
Returning the focus and pressing the button again (or another that
has an effect) restores the sanity.
