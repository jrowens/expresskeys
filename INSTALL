(Look at the end of this file if there is a problem compiling)

Normally just type:

./configure
make
make install

Default installation directory is /usr/local/bin so you must be root for the
"make install" part. Change the target directory if this is undesirable, eg:

./configure --prefix=/home/user

The binary will then be installed to a /home/user/bin directory instead.

Use the "--with-xlib=" and/or "--with-xinc=" options if your Xlib environment
is nonstandard. By default we test what is returned from the commands
"pkg-config --variable=libdir x11" and "pkg-config --variable=includedir x11"
which works in the modular X11R7 releases. If that fails, we try a hardcoded
/usr/X11R6/lib[64] and /usr/X11R6/include for the monolithic X11R6 releases.

Problems?

Make sure that the dependencies for compiling this program are met. Apart from
the normal libraries and header files used for any program development, we need
what loosely can be called an "X development environment". Specifically the
following libraries must be available for linking: libX11.so libXext.so libXi.so
and libXtst.so Header files from X that we must be able to include are:
X11/Xlib.h X11/Xutil.h X11/extensions/XInput.h X11/extensions/XIproto.h
and X11/extensions/XTest.h

Some distributions do not provide this environment by default and therefore
require additional packages to be installed before compiling. Example names
from one distribution are libxi-dev and libxtst-dev for the xinput and xtest
packages.

Example: A "beginner-friendly" distribution like Ubuntu lacks practically
every development package needed for program compilation, in the default
installation. What must to be done, in eg Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) is:

1) Start the Adept package manager and click on the icon to update the list
of available packages - otherwise you won't find the ones we need.

2) Search for libc6-dev and mark it (linux-libc-dev will also get marked).
These packages are required for any C-program compilation.

3) Search for and mark xorg-dev (MANY additional packages will get marked).
This metapackage contains the rest of our requirements - and more.

4) Install.
