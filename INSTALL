The USAGE file contains all necessary information for a proper
configuration and execution of this program. Some extra knowledge
might be had by reading the ChangeLog files. I'm a talkative guy.

After that read, take a look in the extremely simple Makefile in
src-server if setting CFLAGS is your want. Next step is to type:

make

Then copy the binary to a suitable location. There's also the
option to type "make clean", which deletes all the .o files after
a compilation (it will also remove the binary).
