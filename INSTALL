(Look at the end of this file if there is a problem compiling)

Normally just type:

./configure
make
make install

Default installation directory is /usr/local/bin so you must be root
for the "make install" part. Change the target directory if this is
undesirable, eg:

./configure --prefix=/home/user

The binary will then be installed to a /home/user/bin directory instead.

Use the "--with-xlib=" option if your Xlib environment is nonstandard.
By default we look for /usr/X11R6/lib

The old-extra directory holds the expresskeys-reread.sh and
expresskeys-terminate.sh shell scripts. They are not installed by the
GNU Autotools. Copy them manually if you want them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've also left the old style Makefiles in the old-extra directory. If the
GNU Autotools fail for some reason, those are easier to understand and
edit. Then just copy them over to each Makefile in the source directories.
Type "make" and copy the binary to a suitable location.

Problems?

Make sure that the dependencies for compiling this program are met.
Apart from the normal libraries and header files used for any
program development, we need what loosely can be called an
"X development environment". Specifically the following libraries
must be available for linking: libX11.so libXext.so libXi.so and
libXtst.so Header files from X that we must be able to include are:
X11/Xlib.h X11/Xutil.h X11/extensions/XInput.h and X11/extensions/XTest.h
Some distributions do not provide this environment by default and
therefore require additional packages to be installed before
compiling. Example names from one distribution are libxi-dev and
libxtst-dev for the xinput and xtest packages.
