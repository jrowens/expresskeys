Take a look in the extremely simple Makefile in the src-server
directory if setting CFLAGS is your want. Next step is to type:

make

Then copy the binary to a suitable location. There's also the
option to type "make clean", which deletes all the .o files after
a compilation (it will also remove the binary).
