The ChangeLog.old file contains all necessary information for
a proper configuration and execution of this program.

After that read, change the UserConfig-Pad/Pen files to your
taste. Take a look in the extremely simple Makefile if
setting CFLAGS is your want. Next step is to type:

make

Then copy the binary to a suitable location. There's also the
option to type "make clean", which deletes all the .o files after
a compilation (it will also remove the binary). The cleaning
up must be done inbetween configurations in the UserConfig-x and
compiles, otherwise make won't do a new compile.
